Bugs from Keith/Julian:
- PROPPATCH response may be 207 with embedded 423, lock tests
check for 423 directly.  Extend PROPPATCH interface to return
true ne_status structures for each operation?

Features:
* add collection locking tests. 
* add lock-null tests.
* test for collection creation with %20 space
